# databases_lab
This repository contains all the objects related to my experimental studies on both relational and non relational databases, such as:
- database models,
- E-R diagrams,
- SQL scripts
- and NoSQL objects

*All README files in this repository are to provide informations regarding its closest files and directories. That means the objects right next to it.
All these files will likely have the same structure as the README in the root directory.*

## about this README:
This file will provide you with an overview of **how** database_lab files and directories are distributed and **why** they are organized that way.

**Here you will find**:
1. Differences between relational and non-relational databases;
2. An index to further sources of information (README files) inside each directory/project;
3. The main sources of code

## RELATIONAL vs NON-RELATIONAL:

| **Criteria** | **Relational Database** | **Non-relational Database** |
| :------- | :------------------ | :---------------------- |
| **Definition** | The data is stored in tables | It uses hierarchical structure to store data |
| **Stored Items** | The stored items have relationships with each other | The stored items can be structured, unstructured or semi-structured data |
| **Data Integration** | Due to constraints and relationships, data integrity is high | Data integration is difficult |
| **Storage Capacity** | It is suitable for medium to large data size | Large amount of data size |
| **Reliability** | It is highly reliable database | Its reliability is low |
| **Scalability** | The scalability cost is very high | It is highly scalable |
| **Pros** | i) data integrity,<br/> ii) data accuracy,<br/> iii) normalization,<br/> iv) basic structure is easy to understand,<br/> v) easy access of data due to its simplicity,<br/> vi) more secure,<br/> vii) it can be multi-user | i) Can easily handle unstructured data,<br/> ii) high performance,<br/> iii) dynamic changes do not effect other items of database,<br/> iv) it is open-source<br/> v) flexible data model |
| **Cons** | i) Data processing is slow,<br/> ii) there is no support for complex data types,<br/> iii) expensive hardware needed for its scalability,<br/> | i) Its functionality is limited,<br/> ii) manual query language,<br/> iii) data consistency is poor,<br/> iv) backup and consistency issues |
| **Examples** | Relational database examples include MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle Database | Non-relational database examples are MongoDB, Cassandra, DocumentDB etc. |
